  ## Game mechanism
* The musical instrument is randomly selected from the list with multiple answers in the block with the question
* When you click on one of the items in the list with answer options, information about it is displayed in the block with a description of the instrument
* If the player has chosen the correct answer, the name and image of the instrument are displayed in the question block
* At the start of the game score: 0. If the player gave the correct answer the first time, his score increases by 5 points, each next time gives one point less, if the correct answer is given only on the last, sixth attempt, the player receives 0 points for him.
* Sound and color indication is used for correct and incorrect player answers
* When the player gave the correct answer, the "Next" button is activated and he gets the opportunity to move on to the next question.
* After the last question, the score of the game is displayed: "You scored *** points out of *** possible.
* The player is invited to take the quiz again, if not the maximum possible number of points is scored.
* Congratulations and a notification about the end of the game are displayed, if the maximum possible number of points is scored.
  
  ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
